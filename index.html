    <TITLE>Amazon CloudFront Streaming with Longtail Video JW Player 6</TITLE>

    <!--  This HTML file plays an .mp4 or .flv media file using JW Player 6.
    The following code is from the Longtail Video Setup Wizard at
    http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player-setup-wizard.
    -->

    <!-- Call the JW Player JavaScript file, jwplayer.js.
    Replace DOWNLOAD-DISTRIBUTION-DOMAIN-NAME with the domain name of your
    CloudFront download distribution, for example, d1234.cloudfront.net
    (begins with "d"). This causes a browser to download the JW Player file
    before streaming begins.
